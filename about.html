      <p class="laf">
        My name is Nhi Nguyen and I'm currently a fourth year undergraduate at UC Berkeley studying Data Science and Computer Science with a domain emphasis in Business and Industrial Analytics. I love the intersection of programming, data analytics, design, and business and I hope to use my computational skills, creativity, and data-driven insights to drive impacts. 
      </p>

      <p class="laf">
        At UC Berkeley, I am involved in the Student Association of Applied Statistics where I have served as a data consultant and project manager. I have worked and directed client projects to provide business insights and solutions using data analytics and machine learning.
  
      </p>

      <p class="laf">
        Additionally, I am also working as a Data Science Research Assistant for the Berkeley Center of Health Technology where I develop SQL queries, process large datasets, produce visualizations, and analyze models for research publications on biotechnology and health insurance. I was also a part of the Public Editor Project for the Goodly Lab as a Gamification/System Developer where I help develop the leaderboard feature of the website and create front-end design. 
      </p>

      <p class="laf">
        I have also interned at Trimble as a data science intern where I have worked with cloud databases, dashboarding tools, data cleaning/manipulation, forecasting models, and data pipeline automation.
