      <p class="laf">
        My name is Nhi Nguyen and I'm currently a third year undergraduate at UC Berkeley studying Data Science and Computer Science with a domain emphasis in Business and Industrial Analytics. I love the intersection of programming, design, and business and I hope to use my computational skills, creativity, and data-driven insights to drive impacts. 
      </p>

      <p class="laf">
        At UC Berkeley, I am part of the Achievement Award Program sponsored by the Cal Alumni Association. I am also involved in the Student Association of Applied Statistics where I have been part of the Insights and Analytics Committee and Data Consulting Committee.

        Currently, I am involved in the Public Editor Project for the Goodly Lab as a Gamification/System Developer where I help develop the leaderboard feature of the website and create the front-end design. Additionally, I am also a Data Science Research Assistant for the Berkeley Center of Health Technology as well as working as a Data Consultant for the Student Association of Applied Statistics.
