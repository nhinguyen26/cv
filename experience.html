          ByHumankind Consulting Project
        </h3>
        <p>
          As a Data Consultant for the personal care brand ByHumankind, I have implemented clustering algorithm and NLP (natural language processing) model to categorize and identify common customer feedback from a variety of customer reviews data. From here, I have worked with my team to create a report that provide suggestions on how the company can better improve its products and designed a data pipeline for the client to use to process their data in the future. The tools that I used for this projects include Python, Pandas, Numpy, SkLearn, and NLTK.

        <p>
          As a Data Consultant for the media analytics planning, buying, and analytics agency, Media Matters Worldwide, I am working on modeling the impact of various advertising/marketing strategies on sales, building an optimizer that offers real-time budget recommendations, and delivering a customizable data pipeline to streamline this process for every client of the company. The tools that I am using for this project are Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn, and Git. </p>

          Cardiovascular Classifier Project
        </h3>
        <p>
          As a Project Developer for DataGood, an organization dedicated to data science projects for social good, I have developed a machine learning classifier to predict various severities of cardiovascular disease and heart failures in patients. I have performed exploratory data analysis and visualizations to examine the trends in health data, tested machine learning algorithms such as linear, logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting, and applied principal component analysis on heart disease and failure datasets. The final product is a graphical user interface that takes in patient data and output a prediction on their health condition.</p>

          The Materials Project
        </h3>
        <p>
          As a Data Analyst and Researcher for the Alivisatos Undergraduate Research Program, I have completed a research project on the computational investigation of metal oxides for antimicrobial and anti-UV textile applications. In this project, I have extracted, visualized, analyzed data on metal oxdies from the Materials Project Database with Python Materials Genomics to determine the desired chemical properties and extrapolated ideal compounds for real-world applications such as use in hospital or for sunblocking.

          <p>
            As an Undergraduate Lab Researcher for the Hartwig Lab at UC Berkeley College of Chemistry, I have worked on designing new metal enzymes for catalytic purposes to enable chemical reactions to happen and proceed much more efficiently. I have used computational softwares such as Rosetta, Gaussian, and Maestro to perform enzyme designs.</p>
